# Contributing to FKNB

First off, thank you for considering contributing to FKNB! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a great place.

We welcome any type of contribution, not just code. You can help with:
*   **Reporting a bug**
*   **Discussing the current state of the code**
*   **Submitting a fix**
*   **Proposing new features**
*   **Becoming a maintainer**

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/flashcodes-themayankjha/fknb.nvim/issues)
We use GitHub Issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/flashcodes-themayankjha/fknb.nvim/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
*   A quick summary and/or background
*   Steps to reproduce
    *   Be specific!
    *   Give sample code if you can.
*   What you expected would happen
*   What actually happens
*   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We don't have a strict style guide yet, but please try to follow the style of the existing code.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
